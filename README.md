# karel-javascript
Karel compiler on javascript that shows the robot's moves on a webGL canvas. This compiler simulates parallel processing as you can clone robots passing on the call of the function you want them to perform simultaneously.


# How to use
You need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in order to run it.
Just clone the project into a folder, go into the www folder, type node server and access [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) from your preferred web browser.
You can clone karel to perform a specific function calling clone(function()).

Karel's initial position is in the middle of the canvas and the world can be edited in semantico.js to add more beepers or walls.
